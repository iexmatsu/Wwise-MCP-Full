## Tool List

Below is the list of commands exposed by Wwise-MCP, along with example prompts you can give to your MCP client (i.e Claude).

---

### `connect_to_wwise`

**Description**  
Reconnects Wwise-MCP to the currently active Wwise Authoring session.

**Example prompts**

- “Connect to my Wwise project.”
- “Reconnect to the current Wwise session.”
- “Make sure you’re connected to Wwise before doing anything else.”

---

### `resolve_all_path_relationships_in_parent`

**Description**  
Builds a path-first index of all objects under a given parent path (subtree). This lets Claude “see” and navigate the structure of your Wwise project via paths.

**Example prompts**

- “Resolve all path relationships in `\Actor-Mixer Hierarchy`.”
- “Index everything under `\Events` so you can browse my events.”
- “Resolve all path relationships in `\Actor-Mixer Hierarchy\Default Work Unit`.”

---

### `create_objects`

**Description**  
Creates one or more Wwise objects (Actor-Mixers, Buses, Containers, Sounds, Work Units, etc.) given their names, types, and parent paths. If no parent paths are provided, the command can re-use `prev_response_objects` from the last call. 

**Note**: this does not create events as there are more considerations to account for during event creation. Event creation is handled by the `create_events` function (below). 

**Example prompts**

- “Create three child objects called `AM_Footsteps`, `AM_Weapons`, and `AM_Ambience` as ActorMixers under `\Actor-Mixer Hierarchy\Default Work Unit`.”
- “Using the objects returned from the previous call, create a `RandomSequenceContainer` named `UI_Clicks_Random` under each of them.”
- “Create a new bus called `SFX_Master` under `\Master-Mixer Hierarchy\Default Work Unit`.”

---

### `create_events`

**Description**  
Creates multiple Wwise Events in one batch from lists of source objects, destination parent paths, event types, and event names.

**Example prompts**

- “Create a `Play` event called `Play_Footsteps_Grass` for `\Actor-Mixer Hierarchy\Characters\Player\Footsteps_Grass` under `\Events\Default Work Unit\Footsteps`.”
- “Create four `Play` events for these sources: [list paths], and put all of them under `\Events\Default Work Unit\Weapons`.”
- “Batch-create ‘Play’ events for all the sounds you just listed and place them under `\Events\Default Work Unit\Imported`.”

---

### `create_game_objects`

**Description**  
Creates multiple game objects at once in the Wwise sound engine, optionally with initial 3D positions. 

**Note**: Ensure **Start Capture** is toggled before using this command.

**Example prompts**

- “Create five game objects named `RainEmitter_01` through `RainEmitter_05` around the origin at random positions within a radius of 10 units.”
- “Create a game object called `Player` at position (0, 0, 0) and another called `Campfire` at (10, 0, 2).”
- “Create three game objects for birds, spaced evenly along the X-axis from -5 to 5 at Y=0, Z=2.”

---

### `create_rtpcs`

**Description**  
Creates RTPCs in one batch under `\Game Parameters`. You can specify names, parent paths, and min/max ranges. If min/max aren’t specified, assume `0.0` to `100.0`.

**Example prompts**

Creates switches under an existing switch group (whose path should start with `\Switches`).

**Example prompts**

- “Add switches `Rain`, `Snow`, and `Wind` to the `Weather_Type` switch group.”
- “Create switches `Day`, `Night`, and `Dusk` under the `TimeOfDay` switch group.”

---
