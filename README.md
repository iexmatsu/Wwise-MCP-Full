# Wwise-MCP
Wwise-MCP is a Model Context Protocol server that allows LLMs to interact with the Wwise Authoring application. It exposes tools from a custom python waapi function library to MCP clients such as Claude or Cursor.

[Watch the demo and installation guide on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7bVT4yrdmI)

# ⚠️ Experimental Notice

This project is currently in an **EXPERIMENTAL** state. 
It is still under active development and should not be used with Wwise projects intended for production at the moment. Please keep in mind:
- Breaking changes may occur without warning
- Features may be incomplete or unstable
- Documentation may be outdated or missing
- Production use is not recommended at this time
  
# Installation

## Prerequisites
- Install [Claude Desktop](https://www.claude.com/download) or [Cursor](https://cursor.com/download) or any MCP compatible AI platform
- Install [Wwise 2024.1+](https://www.audiokinetic.com/en/download/)
- Install the latest [Wwise-MCP.zip](https://github.com/BilkentAudio/Wwise-MCP/releases/tag/v1.0)

## Setup
- Once you have the above 3 components installed, configure your MCP Client's (i.e Claude's or Cursor's) json file to include the Wwise-MCP application. 
- Refer to the [setup page](https://github.com/BilkentAudio/Wwise-MCP/tree/main/docs/setup) for detailed instructions on setting up with [Claude](https://github.com/BilkentAudio/Wwise-MCP/blob/main/docs/setup/Claude/ClaudeSetup.md) and [Cursor](https://github.com/BilkentAudio/Wwise-MCP/blob/main/docs/setup/Cursor/CursorSetup.md)

# ⚠️ macOS Security Blocker
- On macOS, you will most likely face an error on your first launch of Wwise-MCP after setup due to macOS security.
- To bypass it, open **Terminal** then run `chmod +x "/YourPathTo/Wwise-MCP-v1-0/macOS/Apple Silicon/Wwise-MCP"`
- Make sure to configure the above command to the path where you store your **version (Intel or Silicon)** of Wwise-MCP
- Relaunch your MCP Client (i.e Claude) once more. It may fail again. Navigate to **Privacy & Security** in **System Settings**
- There should be a `"Wwise-MCP" was blocked to protect your Mac` message. Select **Allow Anyway**.
- Relaunch your MCP Client (i.e Claude).

# Quickstart

1. **Connect to your Wwise project**  
   Always start with a prompt akin to **“Connect to my Wwise project”**.  
   This attaches Wwise-MCP to your currently open Wwise session.

2. **Let your MCP Client (i.e Claude) “see” your project structure**  
   Use the **“Resolve parent path”** command.  
   This builds an index of objects under a given Wwise path so Claude can cache and navigate your project by paths.
   A good place to begin is one of Wwise’s top-level roots, for example:
   - `\Actor-Mixer Hierarchy`, `\Containers (Wwise 2025)` 
   - `\Events`
   - `\Switches`, `\States`, `\Game Parameters`
  
   Example prompt:  
   > Resolve all path relationships in actor mixer.

3. Before using any game object–related prompts (e.g. “Post X event on 5 new game objects and spread them around 500 units from the origin”), make sure you’ve enabled “Start Capture” (red when enabled) in Wwise’s Game Object view.

# Features
- **Wwise Session Connection**: Connects to the active Wwise session so the agent can issue WAAPI commands to the appropriate wwise session.
- **Hierarchy Indexing**: Scans a parent path and builds a path-first index of the subtree for fast lookup and navigation.
- **Object Creation & Organization**: Creates actor-mixers, containers, buses, work units, soundbanks, folders, and more under specified parent paths, and can move or rename them in batches.
- **Event Authoring**: Creates multiple Wwise events in one batch from source objects and parent paths, and lists all existing event names.
- **Game Object Management**: Creates, moves, and unregisters game objects in batches, with full 3D positioning support and a global fallback object.
- **RTPC / Switch / State Setup**: Batch-creates RTPCs, switch groups, switches, state groups, and states, and exposes helpers to list and set them at runtime.
- **Audio Import & Discovery**: Imports folders of audio into Wwise under a target parent, and lists all audio files under a given file-system path.
- **Soundbank Configuration & Build**: Includes selected objects in soundbanks and generates soundbanks for specified platforms and languages using project metadata.
- **Runtime Audio Control**: Posts events with optional delays, sets RTPC ramps, switches and states, moves game objects over time, and stops all sounds in the captured session.
- **Layout & Property Utilities**: Toggles Wwise layouts, sets object properties by path, retrieves the current selection, and lists valid property names and value types.
- Refer to [Tools](https://github.com/BilkentAudio/Wwise-MCP/blob/main/docs/tools/ToolList.md) page for detailed explanation of each functionality.
